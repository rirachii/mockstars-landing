## ✍️ How to Create New Blog Posts

### 1. Create a New MDX File
Create a new file in `/content/blog/` with the `.mdx` extension:

```bash
touch content/blog/your-new-post.mdx
```

### 2. Add Frontmatter
Every blog post needs frontmatter at the top:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
description: "A compelling description for SEO and previews"
date: "2024-12-20"
author: "Your Name"
image: "/images/blog/your-image.jpg"
category: "Interview Preparation"
tags: ["interview tips", "career advice", "job search"]
featured: false
published: true
---

# Your Blog Post Content Goes Here

Write your content using standard Markdown syntax...
```

### 3. Frontmatter Fields Explained

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | ✅ | The blog post title |
| `description` | ✅ | SEO description and preview text |
| `date` | ✅ | Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format) |
| `author` | ❌ | Author name |
| `image` | ❌ | Cover image URL |
| `category` | ❌ | Post category |
| `tags` | ❌ | Array of tags |
| `featured` | ❌ | Whether to highlight as featured (default: false) |
| `published` | ❌ | Whether to publish the post (default: true) |

## 🎨 Blog URLs and Navigation

### Example URLs
- `/blog/mastering-star-method`
- `/blog/tell-me-about-yourself-guide`
- `/blog/soft-skills-tech-2025`

## 🔧 Utility Functions Available

The `/lib/blog.ts` file provides these functions:

```typescript
// Get all published blog posts (sorted by date)
getAllBlogPosts(): BlogPost[]

// Get a specific blog post by slug
getBlogPost(slug: string): BlogPost | undefined

// Get only featured posts

```

### 2. Visit Your Blog

Place blog images in `/public/images/blog/` and reference them as:
