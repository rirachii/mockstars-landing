"Tell me about yourself" is arguably the most common interview question, yet it's one that catches many candidates off guard. Despite its apparent simplicity, this question is your opportunity to make a powerful first impression and set the tone for the entire interview.

## Why This Question Matters

This isn't just small talk—it's a strategic question that serves multiple purposes:

- **Reveals priorities**: Demonstrates what you consider most important about yourself
- **Tests preparation**: Indicates how well you've prepared for the interview
- **Sets the agenda**: Often influences the direction of follow-up questions

## The Perfect Structure: Past, Present, Future

The most effective way to answer this question follows a simple three-part structure:

### 1. Past (30 seconds)
Briefly highlight your relevant background and key experiences that led you to where you are today.

### 2. Present (30 seconds)  
Describe your current role and recent accomplishments that demonstrate your value.
