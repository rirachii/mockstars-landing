              <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting that you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this time, no uniform standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been adopted, and we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or other mechanisms that automatically communicate your choice not to be tracked.</p>
              <p>However, if such a standard is adopted, we will update this privacy policy and provide you with details on how we comply with those changes. We encourage users to review this policy regularly to stay informed about our practices regarding online tracking.</p>
